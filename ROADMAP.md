# Phase 1 task list — point-in-time data spine

Gate to proceed to Phase 2 (Master Spec §54): reconciliation passes 30
consecutive days.

## Done

- [x] Repo scaffold, config, DB session management
- [x] Core schema (§9) as SQLAlchemy models: `securities`, `prices_daily`,
      `corporate_actions` (+ `notes`, `rejected_by`/`rejected_at`),
      `fundamentals` (+ `source_snippet`, `confirmed_by`/`confirmed_at`),
      `float_data`, `macro_series`, `data_alerts`
- [x] Alembic migrations 0001–0004 (Timescale hypertable optional/detected)
- [x] Corporate-action math: TERP, cumulative total-return adjustment
      factor series (§7, §P1) — pure functions, unit tested
- [x] Coverage gate logic: Gate 1 liquidity, Gate 2 structural, Gate 3
      integrity veto (§11.1) — pure functions, unit tested
- [x] Point-in-time query helper (§6) — tested against a restatement
      scenario
- [x] Provenance tier enum + "weakest wins" rule (§8)
- [x] cse.lk client verified against the live API: every endpoint is POST
      (not GET), with a hard split between JSON-body and form-urlencoded
      endpoints, plus real 204-No-Content handling. Full trace in
      `backend/app/ingestion/README_ENDPOINTS.md`.
- [x] Corporate-actions ingestion, pairing the "initial disclosure" and
      "(DATES)" follow-up CSE publishes for both rights issues and share
      splits — verified against three independent real events (Asia Asset
      Finance PLC rights issue; Lanka Tiles and First Capital Holdings
      sub-divisions, which use a genuinely different ratio convention from
      rights issues and are now handled correctly rather than guessed).
- [x] Human-confirm workflow API for corporate actions: list/patch/confirm
      /reject, re-validating via the same domain logic the
      adjustment-factor build itself uses.
- [x] **New this session: financial-statement extraction.** Verified the
      `getFinancialAnnouncement` endpoint live (a global recent-filings
      feed, not per-company — see README_ENDPOINTS.md), downloaded a real
      160-page annual report, and built a deterministic line-item
      extractor (`app/domain/financial_statement_parsing.py` +
      `app/ingestion/financial_pdf_extractor.py`) covering the
      totals/subtotals of the balance sheet and income statement. This is
      explicitly NOT the "LLM-assisted line-item mapping" §5 describes —
      see PARAMETERS.md #9 — but it's a genuine, tested capability rather
      than a placeholder.
- [x] Fundamentals human-confirm API: promotes AI-assisted extractions to
      Reported (§8), the workflow the `can_enter_valuation` domain rule
      always assumed existed but that, until now, nothing implemented.
- [x] EOD price ingestion, nightly reconciliation job (§7, internal
      adjusted-vs-raw check only — see PARAMETERS.md #5 for what's still
      missing), scheduler running EOD snapshot / reconciliation /
      corporate-actions scan / financial-statement scan
- [x] FastAPI app: health, securities, corporate-actions,
      fundamentals endpoints
- [x] 145 unit tests passing, most against real captured API/PDF data
      rather than invented fixtures

## Not done yet — next in Phase 1

- [ ] **Confirm-queue frontend** — both confirm APIs exist; there's no UI.
      Usable via curl/httpie for now.
- [ ] **Second data source for reconciliation** (PARAMETERS.md #5) — the
      internal adjusted-vs-raw check exists; an independent external
      cross-check does not.
- [ ] **LLM-assisted extraction** (PARAMETERS.md #9) — needs an explicit
      decision (API key, model, cost) before it's worth building; the
      deterministic extractor covers a real but limited subset of line
      items until then.
- [ ] **Financial-statement historical backfill** — `getFinancialAnnouncement`
      is a recent-filings feed only; a different, not-yet-identified
      source is needed to backfill history to the Part O #2 target
      (2015-01-01).
- [ ] **Plain bonus issue / consolidation**: still unverified after ~40
      tickers probed across two sessions — no live example of either was
      found. Share splits (which looked similar) ARE now verified.
- [ ] **`notifications`/`notifications/corporate` etc.** — exist in CSE's
      frontend code as GET calls but returned 400 live; unused, re-verify
      before building against them
- [ ] 30-day consecutive reconciliation pass — can't be "done," only
      observed once the system is running continuously against live data
- [ ] Sustained-load testing of the cse.lk client's rate limiting
- [ ] The rights-issue/split announcement-pairing heuristic
      (`_pair_rows` in corporate_actions_loader.py) is untested against a
      company with two concurrent events of the same type
- [ ] The financial-statement extractor's canonical label list
      (`CANONICAL_LABELS`) is verified against exactly one real filing —
      wording varies across companies and will need expanding as more
      real filings are processed

## Explicitly deferred to later phases

Fundamental ratios, valuation models, macro/ARDL, factor library, scoring,
AI research writer, decision capture UI, frontend — all Phase 2+ per §54.
Building these against unvalidated data would produce exactly the
look-ahead-biased, false-precision numbers the spec's failure-mode register
(Part N) warns about.
